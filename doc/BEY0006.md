# BEY0006 Element should be named with ALL_CAPS style

## Cause

The name of a C# element does not name with all capital letters (and underscores).

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the names of certain types of elements do not name with all capital letters (and underscores). The
following types of elements should use all capital letters of the element name:

* Constants
* Static Readonly Fields

```csharp
public struct SomeStruct { }

public void ExampleClass
{
    private const int CONST_VALUE = 1;
    protected const string CONST_STRING = "";
    public static readonly SomeStruct CONST_OBJ = new SomeStruct();
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the field so that it's named with all capital letters (and underscores).

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable BEY0006 // ElementMustNamedAllCaps
#pragma warning restore BEY0006 // ElementMustNamedAllCaps
```
