# BEY0011 Non-public unity [SerializeField] should begin with '_'

The name of a non-public unity [SerializeField] should begin with '_'.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when the name of a non-public Unity serialized field (marked with ```[SerializeField]``` or ```[SerializeReference]```) does not begin with ***'_'***.

Non-public Unity serialized fields should always be named with ***_lowerCamelCase***. For example,

```csharp
public class ExampleClass
{
    [SerializeField]
    private int _serializeField;
    [SerializeReference]
    protected List<int> _serializeReference;
    [SerializeField]
    int _internalField;
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name style of the non-public Unity serialized field to ***_lowerCamelCase***.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable BEY0011 // NonPublicUnitySerializeFieldNamesMustBeginWithUnderscore
#pragma warning restore BEY0011 // NonPublicUnitySerializeFieldNamesMustBeginWithUnderscore
```
